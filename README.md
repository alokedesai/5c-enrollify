From the homepage:

"Worried about getting a class, but don't want to keep checking Portal if it's filled up? Use this nifty tool that polls Portal every fifteen minutes and texts you if the enrollment numbers for a class have changed."

From my website:

"5C Enrollify was built for those students of the 5Cs (Claremont Consortium, of which Harvey Mudd is a part) who want to keep a close watch on the slots filled in a class during registration."
